I am Naomi Arnold, a PhD student within the [Networks group](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/research/view/networks) in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). My supervisors are [Richard Clegg](https://www.richardclegg.org) and [Raul Mondragon](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~raul/Rauls_page.html). My research interests are broadly in modelling different social and information systems as evolving graphs. Specific areas of interest to me are:
* Network growth models: model selection and changepoint detection.
* Tools for temporal networks.

I maintain the [FETA](https://github.com/narnolddd/FETA3) (Framework for Evolving Topology Analysis) codebase with Richard Clegg, which can be used for generating graphs from different growth models, and for model selection (paper describing the background and process [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13253)).
