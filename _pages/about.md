Hey, I am Waleed Iqbal, a Teaching Fellow in Computer Science and a PhD candidate (PhD viva passed with minor correction), under the supervision of [Dr. Ignacio Castro](https://icastro.info/) and [Prof. Gareth Tyson](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~tysong/) in the [Social Data Science (SDS) Lab](https://sds.eecs.qmul.ac.uk), [Networks Research Group](http://networks.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) at [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). My research interests are broadly in Manifestation of Socio-Economic Inequality in Online User Activity.

Previously, I worked at [IHSAN Lab](http://ihsanlab.itu.edu.pk/) in [Information Technology University Lahore, Pakistan](https://itu.edu.pk/) and supervised by [Prof. Dr. Junaid Qadir](http://qufaculty.qu.edu.qa/jqadir/) as a postgraduate thesis student, affiliated researcher and teaching assistant.

I received my MSc in Computer Science from [Information Technology University, Lahore, Pakistan](https://itu.edu.pk/) with Dean's Roll of Honors and my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with Honors from [University of The Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan](https://pu.edu.pk/).

Since September 2023, I am endorsed and recognised as UK Global Talent (Exceptional Promise) in Research and Academic Category by Royal Academy of Engineering UK and granted Global Talent Visa by The Government of United Kingdom.
